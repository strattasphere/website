    content: "You get on a discovery call with me and **we talk all about you, where you are at with your business, and if I can help you**. <br><br>If we’re a good fit, then we’ll crack on with getting your course started."
 
  - stage: "02 - Research"
    content: "This is the most important step. <br><br> We make sure that the course you make has **a clear target market, solves a problem that target market has**, and is worth it to your clients spending money on it."

  - stage: "03 - Outline"
    content: "We will get together on the phone (or in-person - I like coffee!) and **extract your knowledge around the topic for this course** so that we can turn that into a course structure. <br><br>You'll receive the course outline and ideas for supporting material to approve, and if needed, have edits made to."

  - stage: "04 - Create"
    content: "The moment we’ve all been waiting for! This is where all our planning comes together.<br><br>**You receive all the the content that has been produced** (lesson plans, slides, and more) and how to work with it when you are recording the lessons."

  - stage: "05 - Deliver"
    content: "All of the finished course content will be setup on the learning platform for you, so it is **hassle free and you don’t having to learn a whole new set of systems.** <br><br>And just like that, you have a course! "

fullStages:
  - stage: "01 - Discovery"
    content: "You get on a discovery call with me and we talk all about you and where you are at with your business. <br><br>**We'll chat about what problem you are trying to solve and what your goals look like.** At that point, I'll let you know if I think an online course is the right solution for you at this moment in time. If I don't think you'll benefit, then I won't waste your money. <br><br>If we’re a good fit, then we’ll crack on with getting your course started."
 
  - stage: "02 - Research"
    content: "This is the most important step. So early on? Yep! <br><br>**This step is what determines whether your course succeeds or fails.** That's why we need to make sure that the course you make is has a clear target market, solves a problem that target market has, and is worth it to your clients spending money on it. <br><br>This will involve surveys, conversations, studies, internet investigating, and some competitor analysis to see if there is a need for this course."

  - stage: "03 - Outline"
    content: "Once we are clear on the target market and the problem your course will be solving, we will get on the phone (or in-person - I like coffee!) and **extract, in-depth, your knowledge around the topic for this course so that we can turn that into a course structure.** <br><br>At the end of this you will recieve the course outline and ideas for supporting material to approve, and if needed, have edits made to."

  - stage: "04 - Create"
    content: "The moment we’ve all been waiting for! This is where all our setup work and interviews come together.<br><br> **When you get the finished outline, detailed lesson plans, slide presentations, presentation notes, workbooks, and other supporting material, time for you to get your hands dirty** (metaphorically, unless you are teaching how to repot a house plant, then, yes, literally).<br><br>You will need to sit down and record the lessons for your course, but don't worry, I will help you every step of the way."

  - stage: "05 - Deliver"
    content: "Once filming is a wrap and everything is ready to go, you need a place to be able to host all your content. <br><br>All of the course content will be setup on the learning platform for you, so it is hassle free and you don’t having to learn a whole new set of systems. <br><br>This includes all videos and supporting material, skeleton landing page (we’ll talk about this later), welcome emails, and any integrations you would like added. And just like that, you have a course! "
